## Pavement Distress Detector Using SIngle Shot Detector

This is my undergraduate thesis, so in here i'm gonna explain the things that i did to (kind of) make this.
<br> 
Before we start, this project is based on [modular implemenntation of SSD in pytorch by Congcong Li](https://github.com/lufficc/SSD). Most of the code was from there, so you should read a few explanation from that repo.

Without further ado, let's get started!
